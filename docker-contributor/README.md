# DOMjudge Docker container for contributors

This directory contains the necessary files to create a Docker image which can be used by DOMjudge maintainers to work on DOMjudge without having to set up a DOMjudge development environment.

The container includes the following:

* A setup script that will:
 * Set up a DOMjudge maintainer installation from a mounted volume.
 * Set up or update the database.
 * Set up the webserver.
 * Create a chroot.
* PHP-FPM and nginx for running the web interface.
* Two running judgedaemons using a chroot.
* Scripts for reading the log files of the webserver and the judgedaemons.
* A script to create a dummy DOMjudge user and submit all test submissions.
* Scripts for enabling and disabling Xdebug.

This container does not include:

* MySQL / MariaDB; the [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/mariadb/) Docker container does this better than we ever could.
* The DOMjudge source code itself. The [DOMjudge repository](https://github.com/domjudge/domjudge) should be cloned on the target machine somewhere and a volume should be created for it.

## Using the image

This image is available on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) as `domjudge/domjudge-contributor`.

Before starting the container, make sure you have a MySQL / MariaDB database somewhere. The easiest way to get one up and running is to use the [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/mariadb/) Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --name dj-mariadb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpw -e MYSQL_USER=domjudge -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=djpw -e MYSQL_DATABASE=domjudge -p 13306:3306 mariadb --max-connections=1000
```

This will start a MariaDB container, set the root password to `rootpw`, create a MySQL user named `domjudge` with password `djpw` and create an empty database named `domjudge`. It will also expose the server on port `13306` on your local machine, so you can use your favorite MySQL GUI to connect to it. If you want to save the MySQL data after removing the container, please read the [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/mariadb/) Docker Hub page for more information.

Next, if you are on Linux make sure you have cgroups enabled. See the [DOMjudge documentation about setting up a judgehost](https://www.domjudge.org/docs/manual/master/install-judgehost.html#linux-control-groups) for information about how to do this. Docker on Windows and macOS actually use a small Linux VM which already has these options set.

Now you can run DOMjudge itself using the following command:

```bash
docker run -v [path-to-domjudge-checkout]:[path-to-domjudge-checkout] -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --link dj-mariadb:mariadb -it -e UID="$(id -u)" -e GID="$(id -g)" -e PROJECT_DIR=[path-to-domjudge-checkout] -p 12345:80 --name domjudge --privileged domjudge/domjudge-contributor
```

Make sure you replace `[path-to-domjudge-checkout]` with the path to your local DOMjudge checkout. On recent macOS and Windows Docker builds, you should add `:cached` at the end of the volume (i.e. `-v [path-to-domjudge-checkout]:[path-to-domjudge-checkout]:cached`) to speed up the webserver a lot.

The above command will start the container, set up DOMjudge for a maintainer install, set up the database and create a chroot to be used by the judgedaemons. It will then start nginx, PHP-FPM and two judgedaemons using supervisord.

You can now access the web interface on [http://localhost:12345/](http://localhost:12345/). Use username `admin` and the password from `etc/initial_admin_password.secret` to log in. Note that for DOMjudge 6.0.0 and higher the webserver configuration will be set up such that the debug front controller will be used.

Note that example data is not loaded, you need to do that yourself by running


```bash
bin/dj_setup_database install-examples
```

### Environment variables

The following environment variables are supported by the container:

* `UID` (defaults to `1000`): the ID of the user to run DOMjudge as. Should match the host OS user ID.
* `GID` (defaults to `1000`): the ID of the group to run DOMjudge as. Should match the host OS group ID.
* `CONTAINER_TIMEZONE` (defaults to `Europe/Amsterdam`): allows you to change the timezone used inside the container.
* `MYSQL_HOST` (defaults to `mariadb`): set the host to connect to for MySQL. Can be hostname or IP. Docker will add hostnames for any containers you `--link`, so in the example above, the MariaDB container will be available under the hostname `mariadb`.
* `MYSQL_USER` (defaults to `domjudge`): set the user to use for connecting to MySQL.
* `MYSQL_PASSWORD` (defaults to `domjudge`): set the password to use for connecting to MySQL.
* `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` (defaults to `domjudge`): set the root password to use for connecting to MySQL.
* `MYSQL_DATABASE` (defaults to `domjudge`): set the database to use.
* `FPM_MAX_CHILDREN` (defaults to `40`): the maximum number of PHP FPM children to spawn.
* `DJ_SKIP_MAKE` (defaults to `0`): set to `1` to skip the maintainer setup and install commands. This will speed up the startup process of the container and is useful if this is already done before.

#### Passwords through files

In order to not specify sensitive information through environment variables, the variables `MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE` and `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE` can be used to set a path to a file to read the passwords from. This is suitable to use together with [docker compose's secrets](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#secrets-configuration-reference):

```yml
...
services:
    domjudge-contributor:
        image: domjudge/domjudge-contributor:${DOMJUDGE_VERSION}
        secrets:
            - domjudge-mysql-pw
        ...
        environment:
            MYSQL_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/domjudge-mysql-pw
        ...
```

### Commands

This container supports a few commands. You can run all commands using the following syntax:

```bash
docker exec -it domjudge [command]
```

If you have named your container something other than `domjudge`, be sure to change it in the command as well.

The following commands are available:

* `nginx-access-log`: tail the access log of nginx.
* `nginx-error-log`: tail the error log of nginx.
* `judgedaemon-log 0` and `judgedaemon-log 1`: tail the log of the first / second judgeaemon.
* `symfony-log`: for DOMjudge using Symfony (i.e. 6.x and higher), tail the symfony log.
* `submit-test-programs`: submit all test programs (by executing `make check test-stress` in the `tests` directory of the DOMjudge installation. This will also add a `dummy` user to your database if it does not exist yet. It's password will be set to `dummy`.
* `xdebug-enable`: enable Xdebug debugging. See note below
* `xdebug-disable`: disable Xdebug debugging. See note below
* `switch-php <version>`: switch to using the given PHP version.

Of course, you can always run `docker exec -it domjudge bash` to get a bash shell inside the container.

To restart any of the services, run the following:

```bash
docker exec -it domjudge supervisorctl restart [service]
```

where `[service]` is one of `nginx`, `php`, `judgedaemon0` or `judgedaemon1`.

### Xdebug

Xdebug is not enabled by default, because it will slow down requests quite a bit. You can enable it by running `docker-compose exec xdebug-enable` and disable it again
by running `docker-compose exec xdebug-disable`.

Xdebug has the following settings:

* `xdebug.remote_autostart=1`: such that you do not have to set a cookie or GET parameter to start debugging.
* `xdebug.remote_enable=1`: enable remote debugging.
* `xdebug.remote_host=host.docker.internal`: connect to the Docker host for debugging.
* `xdebug.idekey=IDE`: the IDE key to use; you should set this in your IDE of choice.

### Accessing the judgings

Because the chroot script copies some special devices into every chroot used for judging and Docker does not support having these special devices on volumes, a bind-mount is created for `[path-to-domjudge-checkout]/output/judgings`. Thus, if you want to access the contents of this directory, use `docker exec -it domjudge bash` to get access into the container and go to that directory.

## Building the image

If you want to build the image yourself, you can just run

```bash
docker build -t domjudge/domjudge-contributor .
```

inside this directory.
